### One team member should fork, then all three should clone that. (don't clone my original)
### There are three incomplete modules in dataProcessingPackage.
### Each team member should
#####     Study the CSV file in the data folder
#####     Study main.py and see how the data gets loaded from the CSV file.
#####     Pick one of the incomplete modules in dataProcessingPackage.
#####     Complete the method in the class. The method should process the data and generate some interesting output

## Do not edit main.py. Do not add any artifacts to the solution or the project.
## Do not rename anything.
